The first digit in the application ID is ‘2’ i.e., even, it is replaced by one greater digit i.e. 3. The second digit in the application ID is ‘4’ i.e., even, it is replaced by one greater digit i.e. 5. The third digit in the application ID is ‘5’ i.e., odd, it is replaced by one lesser digit i.e. 4 and so on. Hence the output is: 354476
