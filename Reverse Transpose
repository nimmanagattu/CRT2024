There is a treasure full of gold and diamonds. Jack Sparrow successfully reached the cave with his black pearl. He is reading a hint on a box that he need to tilt it 90 degree clock wise. But he don't know what to tilt. Finally when he reaches the door there is a dial pad. He remember the hint in the box and he opened the box where it has numbers printed in N x N form. Now he is tilting the same to 90 degree and seeing the numbers. He couldn't see and type on same time. So write a program to print the 2D matrix which will be helpful for him to type easily.
